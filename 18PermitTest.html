  <h1 id="overview">The Permit Test</h1>
<h3 class="paragraph" id="yes">Once you turn 18, you can schedule and take your Permit Lisencing exam. To schedule an appointment with the DMV, you must complete a DMV  <a class="list" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/">California Driver’s License or ID Card Application.</a><insert image carousel from Google Drive>
In the application, you must create a DMV account and will be asked to show forms of identification. You must show a proof of identity document and a proof of residency documents. <br>Valid identification includes:</br>
  <br></br>

Once the application is complete, you can make your DMV appointment. Be sure to schedule your appointment with the same account as your application! We suggest you complete the application at least two weeks before your appointment. This provides ample time to make corrections to your application if it’s rejected. Once the DMV reviews your submission, they will send an email informing you of your status. <br></br>
On the date of the appointment, remember to bring your approved proof of identification, proof of residency, and driver's education completion certificate (the pink paper). Also, it is important to note there will be a fee to take the written test. The price is $37. While waiting for your permit exam, you take a vision test. The vision check will appear similar to this:
<br><img id="vision" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4049/4535381414_e3dd635b4f_b.jpg" alt="Pink Slip" width="50%"
height="auto"/></br>
The last hurdle you will complete before taking the written exam, will be a photo. This image is on your permit and will (most likely) be on your license. Make sure you look picture-ready for your test! <br></br>
Finally, you will take your California Drivers Licensing exam. This was a nerve-wracking experience because the DMV places you in a cubicle to take the test. With an unfamiliar environment and no one around you for support, this experience can be stressful. The method that helped me calm down was feeling prepared. The best resource for the test is the <a class="list"href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/ ">California Drivers Handbook.</a> Every question comes from information present in the booklet. I also recommend you complete as many practice exams as possible. Here are a few of my favorites: 
<br></br>
 <div class="move7">  <h1 class="h7"></h1>

    <table class="table7">
        <tr class="tr" id="top">
           <th class="th">Online Permit Practice Sites:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tr">
            <td class="td"><a class="list" href="https://dmv-practice-test.com/california/car/practice-test-1">DMV Practice Tests: 24 Practice Exams</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tr">
            <td class="td"><a class="list" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-education-and-safety/educational-materials/sample-driver-license-dl-knowledge-tests/">Official DMV Practice Exams</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tr">
            <td class="td">If you complete all of these websites practice exams or you don’t like their format, google “CA permit practice test under 18” for more resources.</td>
        </tr>

    </table>
</div>
 <br></br> 
Also, understanding how the test worked helped me feel more in control of my nerves. In the exam cubicle, the computer will give you a short tutorial on the test format. Afterward, you will begin answering questions. If you correctly answer the question, you will move on to the next multiple-choice prompt. If you answer the question incorectly, the computer will display the correct answer. Then, it moves on to the next page. Examinees must receive a score of 30/36 to pass.<br></br> 
When you pass the exam, you will receive your official permit and can begin preparing for the driving test. You can take the behind-the-wheel exam immediately after you get your permit. <br></br>
It is ok if you don’t pass the exam on your first try! I also did not pass on my first try. I was not expecting many number-based questions so I made a few mistakes. If this happens to you, there is a simple fix! Seven days(not counting the day you took the exam) after you did not pass your permit test, you are eligible to retake it. The situation gives you time to study harder and review the tricky questions. You get three total attempts at the Permit test before you must repay your testing fee and reapply for your permit.
