  <h1 id="overview">The Behind The Wheel Test</h1>
  <h3 class="paragraph"id="you" >Before you are eligible to take your behind-the-wheel driving test, you must complete three steps. After you receive your permit from the DMV you must take a driver training class. You are required to take 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training with an instructor. These classes are hosted (normally) in hour increments. After one session, your instructor will sign your permit to validate it. For the signature to count, it must be from a real licensed driving instructor. <br></br>
	The cost of a driver training courses can be expensive. With classes, the prices vary between $350-$650 for six hours of instruction. It is also possible to purchase classes separately in hour increments. A good way to save money would be to purchase all six hours in a bundle. This price is often cheaper. The driving school I completed cost $380 for the required hours of instruction. I went to <a class="list"href="https://www.chasedriving.com/">Chase Driving School</a> on Colorado Blvd in Los Angeles. A great way to find your perfect course is to search “Drivers training schools near me.”<br></br>
	Once you have a validated permit, you can begin practicing for your exam. California requires that permit holders complete 50 hours of behind-the-wheel training. This is in addition to the 6 hours with a licensed instructor. In total, you must earn 56 hours of driving experience. Ten of your 56 hours must be at night.

If you are NOT driving with a licensed instructor, you must be accompanied by a licensed adult. The adult must be a minimum of 25 years old.  They must be in the passenger seat of your vehicle. Remember, bring your permit on every drive! Driving without your permit is considered illegal and can get you in trouble. Once you complete your driving practice, have your parent or guardian sign your permit. This is how you show you completed your required practice.<br></br>
	Finally, after gaining numerous hours of driving experience, you are eligible for a behind-the-wheel exam. You can take the test exactly six months after you earn your permit. To take the test, you must be 16 years of age. There is no fee for your first attempt. To participate in the exam, you have to make an <a class="list" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/appointments/select-appointment-type">appointment with your local DMV</a>. You will need your permit number to make a DMV appointment! <br></br>
Before you take the exam, you are required to show that your vehicle is properly insured.<br></br>

Now you are ready to take your driving exam! Sometimes, when you are taking exams, it can be stressful. These emotions can affect your driving performance. Whenever I am anxious, understanding the process helps me. When you take the behind-the-wheel exam, you are scored using this sheet: 
<br></br><div><img src="https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dmv3.jpg" alt="Pink Slip" width="50%"
height="auto"/>
  <br></br></div>
This sheet has a lot of information and is difficult to understand. Thankfully, the California DMV provides test takers with a <a class="list" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/driving-test-criteria/driving-performance-evaluation-dpe-scoring-criteria/">driving test criteria handbook.</a> 
This digital booklet provides extensive information on how your test proctor will score your test. <br></br>
When I understand the process, I can calm my nerves by feeling ready. To prepare for my exam, I will be using the <a class="list" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/">CA drivers handbook</a> and reviewing the DMV’s <a class="list" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/preparing-for-knowledge-and-drive-tests/safe-driver-checklist/
">safe driver checklist.</a> Also, I found videos showing students <a class="list" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFCMBXsAluk">what to expect</a> on their driving test and <a class="list" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFCMBXsAluk"> important tips</a> for passing the exam. <br></br>
	When you pass the test, you will be issued a temporary license. The temporary license is valid for 60 days. You will receive your official driver's license within 3-4 weeks of passing the exam. <br></br>
	If you don’t pass, that is perfectly fine! Fourteen days after your test (excluding the date you attempted the previous exam), you are eligible for a retake. Remember, you should schedule an appointment to take any of the exams! On your second attempt, you will be charged a $7 fee.
